# Sacramento Kings International Scouting Project

## Project Overview
This project was developed for the Sacramento Kings Analytics Staff to identify high-potential basketball players currently competing in major European leagues (EuroLeague, EuroCup, Spain - ACB, and Italy - Liga A) who should be prioritized as NBA scouting targets.

The objective was to leverage mock data from disparate sources (simulating real-world vendor data) to perform robust data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and finally deliver a clear, data-driven recommendation report.

## Final Recommendations (Executive Summary)
- Eddie Siva (31, Seminoles — Italy) — Very efficient, high-volume 3-point shooter who also gets to the line. Fits as an immediate floor-spacing guard who can contribute off the bench or as a rotation scorer.
- Oleksiy Dime (28, Broncos — EuroLeague) — Outstanding three-point accuracy at a high volume with strong overall offensive impact. Valuable as a potential stretch scorer in a spacing role.
- Mac Sanli (32, Nittany Lions — EuroLeague) — Veteran floor-spacer with strong 3P% and exceptional free-throw aggressiveness; a safe short-term fit for shooting needs.
- Tanoulis Graham (31, Purple Eagles — Italy) — Smaller sample of minutes but steady shooter and reliable defender—worth a targeted film review as a low-risk role candidate.

## The Report and Analysis
The final report and presentation of findings are delivered via an interactive web application, which allows staff to dynamically explore the data and validation metrics.
